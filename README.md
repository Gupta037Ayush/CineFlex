# CineFlex (Movie-Ticket-Booking)

The Movie Ticket Booking System is a console-based application developed in C++ using MySQL as the backend database to manage and store ticket bookings. The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to provide an efficient way to reserve movie tickets with real-time updates to the database.

Features:
Real-Time Availability: Provides dynamic seat selection and real-time updates on available seats for flights. Ensures that users can view accurate seat availability when making reservations.

Transaction Management: Securely handles booking confirmations. Stores ticket and transaction details in the MySQL database for future reference and audit. Modular and Scalable.

Developed using OOPs principles like classes to ensure modularity and scalability. Allows easy addition of new features and updates without affecting the existing system.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++, Database: MySQL Database, Integration: MySQL Connector for C++, OOP Concepts

System Architecture
Backend: The core functionality of the project is handled using C++ where different OOP components manage flight schedules, reservations, user data, and transaction processes.

Database Integration: A MySQL database is integrated using the MySQL Connector for C++ to store, retrieve, and manage data dynamically. It handles flight records, booking details, and user information.

Real-Time Updates: The system ensures real-time seat availability for flights through direct interaction with the database, dynamically updating seat status as users book or cancel reservations. Installation & Setup Clone the repository to your local machine.
